29/03/20, 2:56 am - +91 99690 86610: No problem
Y'all have fixed UWash?
29/03/20, 2:58 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: I have.
29/03/20, 2:59 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: What about you?
29/03/20, 3:01 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: I am waiting for response from UCSD, but still unclear about UCSD vs Uwash. Any suggestions?
29/03/20, 3:04 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: UCSD's program is very good for a research oriented focus in DS. If you want that to be your primary goal in MS you should go there.
29/03/20, 3:05 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: okay, let's see I will wait 10th Apr and then accept UWash if I don't get any response from them.
29/03/20, 3:08 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Did anyone mail UWash to ask their steps for corona virus outbreak?
29/03/20, 3:09 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: Makes sense. If I was in your position and got an admit from UCSD I would definitely go there. DS at its core is a research based field. From UWash getting a true DS position would be a little difficult. More likely would applied DS/ML engineer/ data engineer.
29/03/20, 3:14 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: correct, but getting admit from there is really difficult.
29/03/20, 3:15 am - +91 84518 92599: Same doubt
29/03/20, 3:25 am - +91 99690 86610: I've a friend in MIS, their webinars are done already
He told me that the department has assured them that they will not be taking a semester online
So if need be they will defer
29/03/20, 3:26 am - +91 99690 86610: I'm waiting for our webinar to know better on this
30/03/20, 11:52 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: Did anyone get the zoom link for the open house webinar?
30/03/20, 11:52 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: yes
30/03/20, 11:53 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: Can you please post it here if it's not confidential, I haven't received it for some reason.

30/03/20, 12:03 pm - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: It's at 12:30 I think
30/03/20, 12:04 pm - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: 12:30 a.m. our time
30/03/20, 12:38 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Okay
30/03/20, 12:50 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Has it started?
30/03/20, 12:50 pm - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: DIdn't check, I will join after 5 mins

30/03/20, 12:54 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Nothing is audible..right?
30/03/20, 12:55 pm - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: yes, everyone is on mute
30/03/20, 12:56 pm - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: should we record this meeting?
30/03/20, 12:57 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Yup we can..
30/03/20, 12:57 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Although they must be recording it too..
30/03/20, 12:57 pm - Khirod Sahoo: We can ask them later
30/03/20, 12:58 pm - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: That is better.
30/03/20, 1:55 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Only 50% of the students got their jobs within 3 months of graduation and our opt duration is 3 months..so is that something to worry about?
30/03/20, 2:33 pm - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: This worried me as well. That seems to be really low right? Not only that, the 50% stat is among the respondents. They don't mention how many people took that survey as a % of the graduating class.
30/03/20, 2:37 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Exactly
30/03/20, 2:42 pm - Khirod Sahoo: But 20% are part time..so they already have jobs
30/03/20, 2:43 pm - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: They did mention that the survey was filled by mostly full-time students.
30/03/20, 2:43 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Is someone asking about that?

18/04/20, 4:01 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: This message was deleted
18/04/20, 4:12 am - Khirod Sahoo: Yeah I have filled the i20 form but need the loan sanction letter from the bank before submitting it..and that is going to take some time..
18/04/20, 4:17 am - +91 80877 44932: Whats your i20 amount? If you wouldn't mind sharing?
18/04/20, 4:24 am - Khirod Sahoo: 55k
18/04/20, 4:26 am - +91 99690 86610: After how many days of paying the deposit did they send the form?
18/04/20, 4:28 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: The form is available for download on your UW portal
18/04/20, 4:28 am - +91 99690 86610: Oh okay, thanks
18/04/20, 4:30 am - Khirod Sahoo: Yes..as soon as you pay the deposit
18/04/20, 4:30 am - +91 80877 44932: Thanks man
18/04/20, 4:39 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: When you accept the offer and pay the deposit, do you get deferral options?
18/04/20, 4:39 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Owing to the pandemic situation..
18/04/20, 4:42 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: UWash has not offered any deferral options right now like many other universities
They are confident of starting on campus in Sept as per schedule
However, they have said that only if we face visa or travel issues, they shall give a deferral later
18/04/20, 4:43 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: Basically, we've been left hanging till August / SeptemberüòÖ
18/04/20, 4:46 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: I'm just skeptical about the deferral.
I don't want to attend remote classes. 
I really hope Fall 2020 starts as usual, but I don't know how likely it is.
And if it doesn't happen and there are remote classes.. Well.. We don't know what we'll do!
18/04/20, 4:47 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: I don't think anybody wants to attend remote classes
18/04/20, 4:48 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: In case the situation isn't good enough for on-campus classes, I guess we US visa services should also not resume by then
In that case, we should get deferrals hopefully
18/04/20, 4:49 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Yeah.
Okay!
We'll have to wait it out..
18/04/20, 12:40 pm - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Regarding financial guarantee docs
Is it mandatory to have the amount converted to dollars, or we can send amount in Rupees (and provide manual conversion in some attachment)??
18/04/20, 1:49 pm - Khirod Sahoo: No..the currency should be mentioned..they can convert them at their end..or you can also convert it in another attachment..
18/04/20, 1:56 pm - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Oh nice
25/04/20, 5:10 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: UWash is still hopeful that Fall 20 will happen on campus.
What are you guys planning? Are you keeping other options open?
25/04/20, 5:13 am - Khirod Sahoo: Planning to attend this fall..but also keeping the option of deferring to next year if situation worsens
25/04/20, 5:16 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: This Fall is tricky.
And UWash isn't talking about deferrals yet.
So I'm wondering if it's safer to accept 2 admitsüôà
25/04/20, 5:17 am - Khirod Sahoo: What's the second admit you have
25/04/20, 5:18 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: I'm swinging between UWash and UMass..
And UMass just gave a lot of options!
25/04/20, 5:19 am - Khirod Sahoo: Yeah but the classes of UWash start late..so they must be very optimistic about starting the classes in time..that's why there are not providing any options now..
25/04/20, 5:21 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Yeah. True.

There is a lot of uncertainty about the session this year. What have you guys planned? Are you all going for deferral since Visa appointments aren't available till before October
13/05/20, 11:31 pm - +91 84518 92599: If there are no visa appointments then i will mostly apply for deferral.
13/05/20, 11:51 pm - +91 96867 61942: Okay. Also there is no official group made by them for the incoming cohort right?
13/05/20, 11:59 pm - +91 84518 92599: No, not to my knowledge
14/05/20, 12:02 am - +91 96867 61942: Okay, thanks :)
16/05/20, 1:06 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Hi, According to i20 it costs 56k $ for first 9 months, any idea regarding the amount of loan we should apply for the course?

16/05/20, 1:07 am - +91 96867 61942: For the entire course

20/05/20, 8:04 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: Has anyone received any updates regarding deferral?
20/05/20, 9:09 am - +91 96867 61942: Granted a deferral‚úãüèª
20/05/20, 9:09 am - +91 96867 61942: If you write to them asking for it they are granting it
20/05/20, 9:30 am - Khirod Sahoo: Deferral to next year fall?
20/05/20, 9:33 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: If you don't mind me asking, did you mention some extenuating circumstance or asked for it generally?
20/05/20, 9:54 am - +91 96867 61942: Yes
20/05/20, 9:54 am - +91 96867 61942: Yes Visa Issue
20/05/20, 10:04 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: what about those who got i20, are you planning to wait for sometime before deferring?
20/05/20, 10:05 am - Khirod Sahoo: Yes
22/05/20, 11:53 pm - +91 99690 86610: <Media omitted>
23/05/20, 12:28 am - +91 96867 61942: Interesting. Probably because most of us deferred for next fall
23/05/20, 2:09 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: They haven't said anything yet about going remote, right?
23/05/20, 2:12 am - Aniket Fadia MSDS: No they haven't 

Hopefully they'll clear all these doubts in the seminar on June 17

26/05/20, 11:25 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Nope
26/05/20, 11:25 am - Khirod Sahoo: And do we have to get our immunization reports in india?
26/05/20, 11:26 am - Khirod Sahoo: But since our classes are starting late..there is a chance that they might start in time and in-person
26/05/20, 11:26 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Yes, before applying for visa I think
26/05/20, 11:27 am - Aniket Fadia MSDS: Yaa hoping to üôà
26/05/20, 11:28 am - Aniket Fadia MSDS: As far as I remember, we can submit the transcripts once we reach the campus

26/05/20, 11:29 am - Khirod Sahoo: No idea ..in the uw admit page it's written that we have to send our transcripts...
26/05/20, 11:32 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: We can ask them in next QnA
26/05/20, 11:34 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: What about loans, did anyone apply for it now?
26/05/20, 11:34 am - Khirod Sahoo: Yes from SBI

26/05/20, 12:08 pm - Aamir Darukhanwala: Oh, I didn't know that they give scholarships
26/05/20, 12:08 pm - Aamir Darukhanwala: For MSDS
26/05/20, 12:59 pm - +91 99690 86610: Me too!
26/05/20, 1:50 pm - Khirod Sahoo: They offer but when I asked them about it they said they have already allocated the scholarships..
26/05/20, 11:30 pm - +91 99232 23065: Hoping to, yes !
26/05/20, 11:33 pm - +91 99232 23065: Who did you reach out for this ? I emailed OSFA and they informed me that there is no Financial Aid awarded to international students. But they did tell me to check-in with International Student Services Office (ISS) to see if they have any scholarship based resources for international students.
27/05/20, 12:00 am - Khirod Sahoo: <Media omitted>
27/05/20, 2:17 am - +91 96867 61942: Was hoping to but circumstances don't seem favourable. So have taken a deferral
27/05/20, 2:17 am - +91 96867 61942: You should try Prodigy
27/05/20, 2:18 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: thanks, will check it

30/05/20, 2:21 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Remote start in the autumn quarter
30/05/20, 2:21 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Yes
30/05/20, 2:31 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: That's because you've already taken deferral
30/05/20, 2:31 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: <Media omitted>
30/05/20, 2:32 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: It is telling that autumn classes are completely shifted to online
30/05/20, 2:32 am - +91 96867 61942: Oh okay
30/05/20, 2:32 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: And international students have options of deferring the course
30/05/20, 2:33 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Or taking online
30/05/20, 2:33 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: I think every other college might do the same for fall semester
30/05/20, 2:33 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: üòì
30/05/20, 2:52 am - +91 96867 61942: Yes, the current situation is deteriorating by the day
30/05/20, 2:58 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Yeah the miracle that I was hoping for, didn't happen !
30/05/20, 2:59 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Is anybody considering online?
30/05/20, 3:02 am - Aniket Fadia MSDS: Yaa, and even more disappointing was that they are not sure about the remainder of the course :/

Whether the remaining semesters will happen online or on-campus üôà
30/05/20, 3:05 am - Aniket Fadia MSDS: Depends on the CPT rules

But entire course online doesn't make sense
30/05/20, 3:07 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: But can't blame them
No university has idea how will this academic year be conducted
Atleast they've stayed true to their word and offered deferrals.
Many other universities that has said that they would give deferrals have taken a u turn.
Also it's good that they're telling us in advance so we can plan for the next year.
30/05/20, 3:09 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: I think other universities will also end up having Fall 2020 online only
30/05/20, 3:17 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Is there any information about the fees for online?
30/05/20, 3:18 am - Aniket Fadia MSDS: Yaa true, nobody knows how the situation will progress ahead! So they have done their best in keeping us updated about the next year as well! 

And plus they are offering deferral which is great!
30/05/20, 4:42 am - +91 96867 61942: Not really. Considering the rest of the academic year 2020-21 is online our OPT might get affected
30/05/20, 4:43 am - +91 96867 61942: Plus it will add another obstacle while finding a job later. Not easy to land a job if you're not a full time student
30/05/20, 4:43 am - +91 96867 61942: This is what I have heard from other friends and relatives who faced a problem

17/06/20, 4:15 pm - +91 90101 38928: Ok
24/06/20, 1:54 pm - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Hi guys
Did the webinar change anyone's mind about online courses?
24/06/20, 6:36 pm - +91 90101 38928: Hi Ananya change in what aspect!
25/06/20, 12:34 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Are you guys considering opting for online classes?
Did the webinar help in making that decision..
25/06/20, 12:49 am - Khirod Sahoo: I couldn't attend the webinar..was there anything important regarding online classes?
25/06/20, 12:50 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: There's a recording available na?
25/06/20, 12:50 am - Khirod Sahoo: On canvas site.. right? I will check
25/06/20, 12:50 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Let me know if it is available now
25/06/20, 12:50 am - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Last time I checked it wasn't
25/06/20, 2:06 am - +91 90101 38928: Yes I m taking them irrespective of webinar I thought I would take
25/06/20, 2:07 am - +91 90101 38928: Webinar dint help it was pretty much good to defer if not in USA from webinar
25/06/20, 2:09 am - Khirod Sahoo: You mean you are opting for online classes?
25/06/20, 2:10 am - +91 90101 38928: Yes as I don't want to wait for more time
25/06/20, 2:11 am - Khirod Sahoo: Great....but don't you think our cpt might get affected if the online classes are extended for one more semester
25/06/20, 2:13 am - +91 90101 38928: Yes but what we can do even if we insist nothing can happen right and I have a kid so I can't be waiting for more time so I am taking
25/06/20, 2:20 am - Khirod Sahoo: Cool..I just have one more doubt..can we attend the classes without procuring a us visa now..?
25/06/20, 2:21 am - +91 90101 38928: I am not sure of that !
25/06/20, 2:24 am - +91 90101 38928: Now I have visa so I don't know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
25/06/20, 2:26 am - Khirod Sahoo: Oh..okay..anyway thanks for your inputs @919010138928
25/06/20, 2:26 am - +91 90101 38928: Wc
25/06/20, 2:27 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: @919010138928 you're already in the US na?
25/06/20, 2:27 am - +91 90101 38928: Yes ananya
25/06/20, 2:30 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: How are things in Seattle?
In terms of the living conditions..
25/06/20, 2:30 am - +91 90101 38928: Cost of living is little high in seattle
25/06/20, 2:31 am - +91 90101 38928: You get everything so food wise all good
 But rents are high
25/06/20, 2:32 am - +91 90101 38928: But it's surrounded by high profile companies so job opportunities are good
25/06/20, 2:35 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Thanks
I meant now that the conditions have changed..
If it so happens that we will be eligible for an internship only if we are in the US, even in case of online classes.
 How easy/difficult would it be to set up everything there.
25/06/20, 2:37 am - +91 90101 38928: Internships are good as of now many are getting summer interns 
But as of setting all other things I am not sure because I live with family here .. any senior who is alone may answer this well
25/06/20, 2:38 am - +91 90101 38928: I mean bachelors pursuing masters
25/06/20, 2:40 am - +91 90101 38928: But unless you have your own funding now part times or on campus jobs kind off things will be not available  and diffucult may be as everything is online
25/06/20, 2:40 am - +91 90101 38928: And outside also it's critical as pandemic it's risky I think
25/06/20, 2:41 am - +91 90101 38928: But you can check with any senior if u know
25/06/20, 2:42 am - +91 90101 38928: In all this only thing would be better if they discount fees then it is a benefit but they won't as per  they mentioned in the webinar
25/06/20, 2:44 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: This helps. Thank you :)
25/06/20, 2:45 am - +91 90101 38928: Wc

16/07/20, 2:36 am - +91 96867 61942: Hey Guys, question to all those who have deferred for next year. We haven't received any email after the deferral mail right? Just confirming if there is something that we have to do in the meantime
16/07/20, 2:36 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: Nope, nothing recieved

15/08/20, 11:05 pm - +91 96867 61942: They aren't taking international students
15/08/20, 11:05 pm - +91 96867 61942: It was mentioned in the deferral mail and on their website too
15/08/20, 11:05 pm - +91 96867 61942: This year is only for permanent residents of US

15/08/20, 11:13 pm - +91 96867 61942: Still going for 2021. Lots of documents to process and it all still seems a lil risky to me.
15/08/20, 11:16 pm - Abhinav Thakur Uw Admit: Mostly, I will also wait for 2021. There are so many uncertainties to worry about this year.

09/02/21, 5:02 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: For those of us who deferred last year. UW is sending out mails to confirm intent for enrollment this year.
09/02/21, 5:02 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: Yes, I received it about a week or two back
09/02/21, 5:03 am - +91 84518 92599: Which course?
09/02/21, 5:03 am - +91 84518 92599: I haven't recieved it.
09/02/21, 5:03 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: Aren't we all on this group MSDS admits?
09/02/21, 5:03 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: MSDS
09/02/21, 5:04 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: Check the personal mail id you provided while applying for admission.
09/02/21, 5:04 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: I received it on 26th Jan
Have a look again
09/02/21, 5:16 am - +91 84518 92599: Checked. Not recieved.
09/02/21, 6:02 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: Might be in your spam folder. Otherwise, they might've missed sending a mail to you since the process is all manual. Send a mail to re-confirm your intent to join, and ask them if anything needs to be done from your end. That should suffice I think.
09/02/21, 6:19 am - +91 96867 61942: Yes even I received a week or so ago
09/02/21, 6:19 am - +91 96867 61942: Also I had sent my transcripts for verification and reached on 25th Jan. It still doesn't reflect on their portal. Anyone facing a similar issue?
09/02/21, 6:20 am - +91 96867 61942: Or faced a similar issue previously?
09/02/21, 6:27 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: I faced an issue with it last year. But that's not a problem you can get that verified when you reach on campus as well. I confirmed this with them.
09/02/21, 6:30 am - +91 96867 61942: Oh great, thanks a lot
09/02/21, 6:31 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: Great, Thanks
09/02/21, 7:21 am - Khirod Sahoo: Do we need to send our transcripts before joining there?
09/02/21, 7:27 am - Utkarsh Sharma Uw MSDS: It's upto you. You can submit those when you reach there, or in advance. I sent my transcripts and my graduation statement. But could not send a copy of my degree as the university only provides duplicates after loss of the original and a police complaint üòÖ.

07/05/21, 9:20 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: Hi everyone, in the DS-160 form, what are you guys filling as the intended length of stay? 
Since the end date 18 August 2023 is it supposed to be 2 years or 1.5 years according to the program length?
07/05/21, 9:45 am - Shweta Mayekar Uwash: I put 2 years
07/05/21, 9:48 am - Khirod Sahoo: Same..the program length in i20 is also 23 months I think
07/05/21, 10:35 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: Okay, and did you guys ask this from someone from UWash?
07/05/21, 10:36 am - Khirod Sahoo: I didn't ask uwash..I asked some friends..they had put the exact duration mentioned in their i20s..
07/05/21, 10:39 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: Oh alright, that is the understanding I have too, but not sure, have mailed them regarding this as well
07/05/21, 10:43 am - +91 96867 61942: They put in extra months because sometimes people extend the program
07/05/21, 10:43 am - +91 96867 61942: So that is the duration after extension
07/05/21, 10:43 am - +91 96867 61942: Otherwise it is 1.5 years
07/05/21, 10:53 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: Oh didn't know that they allowed extension by another quarter. I thought since I-20 end date is August, everyone by default has time until October to find jobs (lol)
The program advisors told you this?
07/05/21, 10:56 am - Aniket Fadia MSDS: I've put 23 months
07/05/21, 10:57 am - +91 96867 61942: No seniors had but you can confirm

08/05/21, 10:42 am - Khirod Sahoo: Are you guys planning to vaccinate yourself in India or in USA?
08/05/21, 10:44 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: India only as far as possible
08/05/21, 10:44 am - +91 98211 63479: Same
08/05/21, 10:46 am - Khirod Sahoo: I am only worried what will happen if we don't get the second dose in time after getting the first dose
08/05/21, 10:46 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Yup, India
08/05/21, 10:46 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: We have time..
08/05/21, 11:22 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: Considering second dose to be given between 6-8 weeks, if we get the first dose by June first or second week, we would still have time until August first week to get the second one which is quite sometime 
But something also concerning is the  availability of the second dose..
08/05/21, 11:24 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: Also, in the sevis information section what did you guys fill as Course of study? 
Should it be data science/information science (according to I20)? Have you also verified it from UWash?
08/05/21, 12:00 pm - Khirod Sahoo: I have filled masters in data science
08/05/21, 12:01 pm - Amrit Bhat MSDS: After verifying?
08/05/21, 12:03 pm - Aamir Darukhanwala: I filled in Information Science as it was mentioned on the i20
08/05/21, 12:04 pm - Amrit Bhat MSDS: Yeah, even I thought this should be filled since it's directly from the ISS. Why wouldn't they specify Data science instead..
08/05/21, 12:05 pm - Amrit Bhat MSDS: So confused at this point
09/05/21, 12:34 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: <Media omitted>

17/05/21, 12:38 pm - Shweta Mayekar Uwash: Thinking 20th

18/05/21, 10:46 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: Hi guys, has anyone here paid the MRV fee through NEFT? What is supposed to be the "unique account number" that we should show on the day of the interview? Is it the Unique Beneficiary Account number stated on the NEFT details page starting with "TIER..."?
08/06/21, 4:00 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Hi everyone
Do we have to complete some ISS session before we can register for courses?
08/06/21, 4:00 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: I can't see anything on  Canvas but everyone else seems to be doing it üôà
08/06/21, 4:01 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Also, which embark session are you people registering for?
08/06/21, 4:02 am - Aishwarya Uwash: I got confused with that too.... its not on canvas, its on the myUW page - https://my.uw.edu/https://my.uw.edu/

Is anyone petitioning for an alternate course this quarter?
20/06/21, 11:16 pm - +91 70931 74555: Which one are you planning to swap? And with what?
20/06/21, 11:16 pm - +91 70931 74555: We have 3 right?
1. Stats and Probability
2. Data Visualisation
3. Topics in Data Science
20/06/21, 11:56 pm - +91 88846 04504: Yeah
21/06/21, 1:23 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Still figuring out which other courses are accepting grad students rn. It's very professor specific.

But my confusion as of now is that how do we prove proficiency in a particular subject 
So if anyone has done it I could use some help :)
21/06/21, 1:27 am - +91 97397 61811: During the webinar, I remember they mentioned submitting transcripts to prove you have credits in that particular course.
21/06/21, 1:30 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Yeah the policy says the same. Thanks :)

But my university had non intuitive course names, to say the least.
Mathematics 1,2,3.. No way of proving whether it had stats or not üôà
21/06/21, 1:30 am - +91 88846 04504: Ah yeahh same
21/06/21, 1:30 am - +91 88846 04504: Maybe you can attach the syllabus with it?
21/06/21, 1:31 am - +91 88846 04504: That's what I did on alot of applications
21/06/21, 1:31 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: They also say relevant work experience.. So somehow we may be able to show that?

21/06/21, 1:35 am - +91 97397 61811: Got it! Thanks :)
21/06/21, 1:39 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Looking forward to see how 4 hours of the same corse goes üôà

21/06/21, 1:47 am - Khirod Sahoo: Do we have to register to be able to see this?
21/06/21, 1:47 am - Khirod Sahoo: And to register, do we need to submit immunization proof?
21/06/21, 1:47 am - +91 97397 61811: Nope. I registered, without submitting my proof.
21/06/21, 1:48 am - +91 97397 61811: Haha. I had the same doubt. üôà

21/06/21, 8:03 am - Khirod Sahoo: Cool!!

Also ,Has anyone acquired any CA certificate of all asset holdings?

21/06/21, 10:28 am - Khirod Sahoo: Ok, and when asked about the fundings, people generally start with  savings ,FDs, and then they say additionally they have a secured a loan as well...what should I do if my primary source of funds is loan and do have much liquid funds to show?
21/06/21, 10:30 am - Khirod Sahoo: *do not have much liquid funds to show
21/06/21, 10:31 am - Khirod Sahoo: I was thinking to carry a CA certificate for the same purpose showing total asset holdings(including immovable assets) of my family...not sure if I should I speak about the immovable assets that I have
21/06/21, 10:33 am - +91 97397 61811: Would be good to talk about immovable assets. That shows that you have some ties to your home country.

30/06/21, 12:24 pm - +91 98332 55430: Hi, did everyone confirm the Insurance/Optional charges before registering for courses?

26/07/21, 11:31 am - +91 83101 79085: I've been admitted to the MSAII program
26/07/21, 11:31 am - +91 83101 79085: But the CMU courseload, omg, I'd rather die tbh..
26/07/21, 11:31 am - +91 98211 63479: Oh that's nice. I applied too. Got rejected after being waitlisted ü•≤

26/07/21, 11:32 am - +91 78270 62118: Is this weird that all of us here have/had CMU admits? üôàüôà

26/07/21, 11:34 am - +91 98196 02059: Huskies >> Scottish Terriers
26/07/21, 11:34 am - +91 83101 79085: Also can we rename this group from UWash to UW? My sister says people from UW insist it not being called Uwash, its pronounced UDub

26/07/21, 11:35 am - +91 98222 70678: Yea... seems a fair point from UW tho...
26/07/21, 11:36 am - Shweta Mayekar Uwash changed the subject from "UWash MSDS Fall21 admits" to "UW MSDS Fall21 admits"
26/07/21, 11:36 am - +91 98211 63479: Course structure mostly. Too packed with lot of courses I didn't think I'd enjoy. Plus return on investment compared to UW. Also I was really hoping to get into the MSAII program and UW is a better option based on the things I wanted
26/07/21, 11:37 am - +91 83101 79085: Are you into entrepreneurship as well Hriday?
26/07/21, 11:37 am - +91 83101 79085: I am looking to explore startups while UW as well!
26/07/21, 11:39 am - +91 98211 63479: Not particularly but my parents are and I figured I'd have a better shot at MSAII compared to MCDS üòÖ
26/07/21, 11:39 am - +91 78270 62118: What kind of startups?
26/07/21, 11:40 am - +91 83101 79085: Oh, i am surprised though, why would you think so? MSAII is the most selective program at CMU with a 6% selectivity rate from what I've heard
26/07/21, 11:41 am - +91 83101 79085: Anyways i am just so afraid of the CMU courseload and Pittsburgh as a city, gotta skip it
26/07/21, 11:41 am - +91 83101 79085: Also the person calling me loner didnt help :(
26/07/21, 11:41 am - +91 98211 63479: MCDS is much more competitive though. And MSAII is relatively newer so I figured it wouldn't be as competitive. And it's still CS department and good mix of courses

26/07/21, 11:42 am - +91 98211 63479: I could be wrong, I acted on advice from friends who were already studying in the US back then

30/07/21, 12:31 pm - +57 318 8030539: I understand that if we choose quarterly, and we don‚Äôt register any classes, we are not elegible to get insured during the summer. But does this also apply for annual coverage?
30/07/21, 12:32 pm - +91 98211 63479: I think same applies for annual coverage

04/08/21, 4:46 am - +91 97397 61811: That's the STEM nomenclature. There's no explicit course code for Data science.
04/08/21, 4:51 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: Actually there is a CIP code for Data Science in the list
But no programs use that code since it isn't STEM

22/08/21, 1:11 am - +91 97397 61811: Haven‚Äôt bought one yet. Planning to get it once I get there. 

I‚Äôm open to recommendations too!
22/08/21, 1:20 am - +91 98211 63479: I'm planning to use the university's checkout service at least for a while. One of my friends from HCDE uses this and says it's good but I haven't been able to get details about how it works and if you get things that are fairly new on the market
22/08/21, 1:25 am - Aamir Darukhanwala: I'm planning to take along my 4 year old laptop. It's still working fine.
I plan to use the university checkout laptop for college use there. Everything is on the cloud anyways.
I'll buy a new one eventually when I feel the need to.
22/08/21, 1:30 am - +91 98211 63479: I plan to get an M1 MacBook if prices drop and if the checkout service doesn't work out. Most overheating and resulting hardware defects that were present in Intel chip MacBooks seem to have been resolved now

I do not have my personal laptop to use in case of emergencies - it's in bad shape. So, I wanted to see how soon will I be able to get the uni laptop. If it's soon, I tok will not hurry to buy one - and can wait for the right time and need.
22/08/21, 2:31 am - +91 98211 63479: I'll let you know if I find out anything

26/08/21, 12:52 pm - +1 (510) 709-9076: I think that‚Äôs mostly the case

31/08/21, 2:20 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Guys , does anyone have any information on the schedule and duration of our 3rd lecture - special topics in data science?
31/08/21, 2:37 pm - +91 98211 63479: They said in the webinar it's an asynchronous class where the professors sometimes schedule time for discussions and questions. I guess that means there are no fixed weekly classes
31/08/21, 2:44 pm - Khirod Sahoo: Oh..thanks!!
01/09/21, 10:04 pm - +91 87900 41485: Hi! Is there anyone in this group travelling to Seattle on the 8th?
01/09/21, 10:11 pm - +91 97397 61811: üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
01/09/21, 10:44 pm - +91 98211 63479: I am
02/09/21, 2:07 am - Shweta Mayekar Uwash: Me too
03/09/21, 6:15 am - Shweta Mayekar Uwash: Hi. Do we need to make the payment of $1664 which includes UPass & insurance before receiving the UPass?
I was thinking I'll make that payment on priority followed by the tuition fees. Let me know what you guys are thinking
03/09/21, 6:46 am - Khirod Sahoo: Have you taken annual insurance?
03/09/21, 6:46 am - Khirod Sahoo: Even I am thinking to pay this fee on priority
03/09/21, 6:46 am - +91 98211 63479: I paid for UPass and insurance first to avoid problems wrt insurance. We're looking at Western Union to pay the fees because FlyWire was slightly expensive.
03/09/21, 6:47 am - Shweta Mayekar Uwash: Yes
03/09/21, 6:47 am - Khirod Sahoo: Oh what's the exchange rate of western union?
03/09/21, 6:47 am - +91 98211 63479: I'm not sure but when I checked the fee amount there was a different of around 9k
03/09/21, 6:47 am - +91 98211 63479: On WU and FlyWire
03/09/21, 6:48 am - +91 98211 63479: Difference*
03/09/21, 6:49 am - Khirod Sahoo: How will you pay through Western union..the bank from where you have taken loan will process that..right?
03/09/21, 6:51 am - +91 98211 63479: I haven't taken a loan. My parents might transfer through WU to my US bank account or there is also a direct option to pay fees via WU which I haven't really looked at properly
03/09/21, 7:01 am - +91 98332 55430: I have taken a loan from HDFC. But they will send the money to my Indian account first, and we can choose any 3rd party (or their references) to transfer to US
03/09/21, 7:04 am - +91 99232 23065: +
03/09/21, 7:05 am - Khirod Sahoo: That's good .sadly sbi doesn't trust us much..they said they would only transfer our fees to university..
03/09/21, 7:06 am - +91 99232 23065: Is there major diff b/w you transferring vs the bank ?
03/09/21, 7:09 am - +91 87900 41485: Do we have to pay the UPass/Insurance fees and tuition fees seperately? Or can it be done at once via Flywire?
03/09/21, 7:12 am - Khirod Sahoo: I don't know..i have only 2 options..bank will send it.. either through flywire or their own bank wire channel
03/09/21, 7:13 am - +91 97397 61811: Same here. 

When I looked at Flywire vs WU, the former was cheaper. But this was for the entire outstanding amount.
03/09/21, 7:19 am - +91 97397 61811: This is a good idea, Thanks! I‚Äôll pay this bit too.
06/09/21, 4:50 am - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Hey!
Which laptop are you people planning to buy?
06/09/21, 10:01 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: I personally am an Apple person, and was never let down by my MacBook. So my verdict would be a MacBook. But many of my batchmates used vanilla windows laptops and surface laptops, and I don‚Äôt think they faced any problems as well. It now boils down to you for what OS you‚Äôre comfortable with
06/09/21, 10:01 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: Don‚Äôt worry about getting a high end laptop thinking you‚Äôll be training a lot of deep neural networks or so - Most assignments will be done on some kind of cloud based platform :)
06/09/21, 10:03 am - Amrit Bhat MSDS: So this is an advice I received from an alumni, if it helps. 
I'm also a Mac person, though haven't decided on a version yet
06/09/21, 12:24 pm - Ananya Sharma UW Admits: Thank you!

14/09/21, 4:40 pm - +91 98332 55430: I was confused between M1 and  intel only

I think we all were expecting in person classes this fall
but unfortunately that is not true
21/09/21, 5:29 pm - Anagha UW: <Media omitted>
21/09/21, 5:35 pm - Anagha UW: obviously we all have different preferences, but folks who want to attend classes in person, i wish had the choice to do so. especially the ones who defered due to the pandemic / virtual classes. Since we have our orientation today at 6 - online - unlike the other programs that are having in person orientation (MSIM)

Wanted to bring it up in today‚Äôs connect if most of you guys feel the same way.

do let me know thanks.
21/09/21, 5:44 pm - +91 87900 41485: Yup! I feel the same way, I would prefer an in person class over just a doubt clearing session
21/09/21, 5:45 pm - +91 87900 41485: We could definitely bring this up on today's orientation session if there are others as well who feel the same way
